          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah">Cheetahs</a> are
          fast-running big cats found primarily in Africa and parts of Asia.
          Known for their incredible speed, they can reach up to 60 miles per
          hour in short bursts. Cheetahs have slender bodies, long legs, and
          distinctive black tear marks on their faces, helping them hunt prey

        <h2>Giraffe</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe">Giraffes</a> are the
          tallest land mammals, native to Africa. With their long necks and
          legs, they can reach high tree branches to feed on leaves and fruits.
          Giraffes are known for their distinctive spotted coats, which help
          them blend into the savanna. They are peaceful herbivores and live in
          social groups called towers.

        <h2>Hippo</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus">Hippos</a> are
          large, semi-mammalian mammals native to sub-Saharan Africa. They spend
          most of their time in water to keep cool and protect their skin from
          the sun. Despite their bulky size, hippos can run surprisingly fast on
          land. They are herbivores and play a significant role in maintaining
          river ecosystems.

  <p>Cheetahs are fast-running big cats found primarily in Africa and parts of
    Asia. Known for their incredible speed, they can reach up to 60 miles per
    hour in short bursts. Cheetahs have slender bodies, long legs, and
    distinctive black tear marks on their faces, helping them hunt prey with
    precision in open grasslands.</p>
